    "My husband loves omelettes and nothing makes him happier. 
    When cooking an omelette, it's important that you keep your
     temperature on the low side, as you don't want your omelette to get brown.""
    </p>
<p>Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed </li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste  </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter  </li>
        <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese  </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Steps
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with a whisk. Add milk and season with salt 
            and white pepper. Whisk for a few minutes until egg mixture is 
            foamy; beating in air makes the omelette fluffy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 
            Pour in egg mixture and twirl skillet so bottom is evenly covered
             with egg. Cook for 1 minute until egg starts to set. Lift edges 
             with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg mixture can 
             run towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no 
             visible liquid egg remains. </li>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 
            minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese in one line in the middle of 
            the omelette and fold omelette in half. Cook for 20 seconds, then 
            slide omelette onto plate.</li>
    </ol>
